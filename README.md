## What Learnt

In coding this lesson, I was able to undrstand the implementation of ggrid template areas, as this is used in arange the items of the calculator.

## Language stack used for development

- JavaScript
- HTML
- SCSS compiled to CSS

## Tiny adjustments made from original project

- CSS is compiled from SCSS and not written directly as a CSS file. This saved time and increases strength in understanding how SCSS compiling works and setting up the code extension for the output directory.

```json
{
  "liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
    {
      "format": "compressed",
      "extensionName": ".min.css",
      "savePath": "/dist/public/css",
      "savePathReplacementPairs": null
    }
  ]
}
```
